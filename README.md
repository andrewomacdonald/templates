### Commonly Used Templates

I got tired of Googling for every basic question I had when beginning a project because I apparently have the memory of that guy from Memento, so I decided to make a repository of templates and commonly used snippets. This is basically a toolbox. I'll constantly add new things here. I'll try to keep things organized and nicely worded so if you need anything, feel free to check this out and grab whatever you want.

If you have a burning desire to add something here, go ahead and make a PR or email me: andrew.o.macdonald@gmail.com.
